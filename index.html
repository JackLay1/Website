    <h3>Conway's Game of Life in C</h3>
    <p>This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C. It does not have graphical capabilities beyond refreshing the grid and printing it to the console. I created this project as part of my effort to learn C and to deepen my understanding of basic programming concepts, memory management, and logic implementation. The focus is on the core mechanics of the game, demonstrating how complex behaviors can emerge from simple rules in a terminal-based environment.</p>

    <h3>Text adventure Dungeon In C</h3>
    <p>This project initially started as a Java-based text adventure with a secondary screen. </a> <a href="#adventuremap"><u>See this for the original.</u></a>  <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/TextAdventureC"> Due to encountering some unusual bugs and my eagerness to learn C, I transitioned to developing a C-based text adventure. In the process, I implemented a stack, Wave Function Collapse, and other features.</p>
</a>
<br>


    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/WFC">
    <h3>Wave Function Collapse In C</h3>
    <p>This is a simple implementation of Wave Function Collapse (WFC) written in C, primarily intended for use in my C-based text adventure. It eliminates the need for the stack I had previously built for the project but can easily be modified for other uses. This project is part of my ongoing exploration of procedural generation.</p>

    <a href=https://github.com/jackhlay/CStack>
        <h3>Stack implementation in C</h3>
        <p>This is a basic implementation of a stack, initially created for use in my C-based text adventure. It is also intended for use in future C projects.</p>

    <a href=https://github.com/jackhlay/Prime-Ratios>
        <h3>Prime Ratios Plotter</h3>
        <p>This Python script quickly generates a list of prime numbers within a specified range. It then compares each prime to the one following it, plotting the ratios alongside the average ratio. Ideal for visualizing prime number distribution and patterns.</p>
    </a><br>

        <h3>Senior Capstone Project 2 - Cheat Maps</h3>
        <p>In the second semester of work for our senior capstone project, my role was to transfer the local api, and its functionality to a serverless solution leveraging industry standard cloud services through AWS. In addition, we added an authetication layer, allowing a select group of users to view user posts and verify their validity. as cheat grass, and released the app to both apple and google play app stores</p>

      <h3>Chess Engine</h3>
      <p>The culmination of a year-long endeavor my Chess engine begins to evolve into something real. Originally a prototypical python script, my chess engine is transitioning into a powerful GoLang backend solution. Through diligent learning and refinement, I now am working to build closer to industry conventions and best practices. With a successful working prototype in tow, integration with the Universal Chess Interface (UCI), will ensuring ease of use and universal compatibility. </p>

        <h3>Senior Capstone Project 1 - HabitatAPI</h3>
        <p>This is a project done in collaboration with the Bureau of Land Management, in an effort to track an invasive species of grass called cheat grass in the gunnison valley. In this first semester of this project, we researched technologies, and created a useable offline prototype. I was responsible for writing the api we would use to test and model final app behaviors.</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/DroneUI">
      <h3>Drone GUI</h3>
      <p>Leveraging multiple object-oriented principles (including MVC, Adapter, Command, and Observer patterns), we were tasked with developing an intuitive GUI that allows for users to select points on a live map, then gneerates instructions for a quadrotor to follow.</p>
    </a><br>
    
    <a href=#2023>
        
      <h3>Skishop Simulator</h3>
      <p>Using Java and object-oriented principles, we developed a sleek ski shop simulation with effective inventory management, sales, scheduling, and customer satisfaction scores. This also included proper unit testing and well-documented UML structure changes.</p>
    </a><br>
    
    <!--    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/Chessguy/tree/Front-End-Era">-->
    <!--  <h3>Drone UI</h3>-->
    <!--  <p>In this Python project utilizing pymavlink, we established seamless communication with drones. We began by developing an intuitive GUI, facilitating the transmission of point clusters to a simulated drone. With successful implementation, we progressed to real-time control using pygame. This phase allowed us to receive controller input, enabling fluid movements of the simulated drone. Crucially, this groundwork positions us to seamlessly transition to real drone control by sending instructions directly to the flight controller. Experience the project on GitHub for an in-depth exploration.</p>-->

      <h3>Chess Engine</h3>
      <p>In January 2023, I kicked off my chess engine project using Python. After a couple of rewrites and a brief stint with a Java front end, I found the pure Python approach to be the best fit. Despite challenges like switching between languages, this journey honed my skills in GUI creation, data management, and algorithm implementation. By year-end, I had implemented chess rules and early positional evaluation, achieving a functional prototype to iterate on further.

    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/Reverse-Chess-Positional-Eval">
      <h3>Chess Analysis Using Neural Networks</h3>
      <p>In order to flex my proverbial Machine Learning muscle, I wrote a Neural Network using Tensorflow and Keras to evaluate random chess positions from Stockfish, and predict the evaluation. This was a very fun project, and helped to solidify my interest and skills in Machine Learning.</p>
    </a><br>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/Gym-Q-Learners">
      <h3>Q Learners w/ OpenAI Gym</h3>
      <p>In this project, in order to strenghten my Machine Learning skills I wrote A Q Learner, an Approximate Q Learner, and a Deep Q Network then trained them on games within OpenAi's Gym. You can see rough results in the report.</p>

      <h3>Text Adventure w/ Inventory Screen</h3>
      <p>Also a WIP, my Java text adventure game is a that includes a screen for inventory and location management, adding a visual element to a classic game genre. It functions similarly to other text adventure games, with input limited to an integrated console. This project showcases my Java programming skills and innovation in traditional game design.</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/Noise-Generator">
      <h3>Noise Generator</h3>
      <p>Written in Java, this is a simple project that will generate random noise. To accomplish this it first will set a base layer to a color, then generates 2 random numbers to form a coordinate that corresponds to a pixel on the screen. Every time a pixel is selected its alpha layer is increased. It will let you customize the number of attempts, as well as the size of the image. If you want you can save the image. Additionally it exports a list of coordinates. This served as a way to strenghten skills in I/O, GUIs, and data structures.</p>

      <h3>Analyzing Patterns in Sports Gambling</h3>
      <p>This was a data analysis project. Leveraging python, and using common data science libraries Pandas and SciPy for multilinear regression I wrangled and analyzed nba betting data from '07-'08 through '22-'23 NBA seasons to see if betting on the point spread is actually more profitable than betting on the moneyline underdog. This project was in an applied data science class where we went through the entire process of hypothesis formation and testing, actual analysis of results and confirmation/denial of your hypothesis, and a formal presentation of findings. You can view the slide deck here.</p>

      <h3>Network Enabled TicTacToe</h3>
      <p>This was a software engineering project. Written in Java, we created a Tic-Tac-Toe with a fully working GUI, that would allow 2 people on the same network to play TTT. We used a work infrastructure similar to the Agile framework.</p>

    <h3>RPG Game</h3>
    <p>Written in python, we created a small but robust RPG style game. It had save state capabilities, allowing for many characters with their own inventories and names. It had a combat and leveling system, allowing for visible progression through the game, as well as the option to fight a final boss when leveled high enough.</p>
