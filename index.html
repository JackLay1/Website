    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/Reverse-Chess-Positional-Eval">
      <h3>Chess Analysis Using Neural Networks</h3>
      <p>In order to flex my proverbial Machine Leraning muscle, I wrote a Neural Network using Tensorflow and Keras to evaluate random chess positions from Stockfish, and predict teh evaluation. This was a very fun project, and helped to solidify my interest and skills in Machine Learning.</p>

      <h3>Q Learners w/ OpenAI Gym</h3>
      <p>In this project, in order to strenghten my Machine Learning skills I wrote A Q Learner, an Approximate Q Learner, and a Deep Q Network then trained them on games within OpenAi's Gym. You can see rough results in the report.</p>

      <h3>Chess Engine</h3>
      <p>My chess engine is a WIP testament to my advanced programming skills, showcasing my ability to manage complex algorithms, use diverse data structures, and integrate an AI agent for optimal strategic decision-making. Through this project, I honed my skills in software design, algorithmic optimization, and data management, culminating in a powerful tool that provides a true challenge for chess enthusiasts at any level. My chess engine is a shining example of my programming capabilities and technical expertise.</p>

      <h3>Text Adventure w/ Inventory Screen</h3>
      <p>Also a WIP, my Java text adventure game is a that includes a screen for inventory and location management, adding a visual element to a classic game genre. It functions similarly to other text adventure games, with input limited to an integrated console. This project showcases my Java programming skills and innovation in traditional game design.</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/jackhlay/Noise-Generator">
      <h3>Noise Generator</h3>
      <p>Written in Java, this is a simple project that will generate random noise. To accomplish this it first will set a base layer to a color, then generates 2 random numbers to form a coordinate that corresponds to a pixel on the screen. Every time a pixel is selected its alpha layer is increased. It will let you customize the number of attempts, as well as the size of the image. If you want you can save the image. Additionally it exports a list of coordinates. This served as a way to strenghten skills in I/O, GUIs, and data structures.</p>

      <h3>Analyzing Patterns in Sports Gambling</h3>
      <p>This was a data analysis project. Leveraging python, and using common data science libraries Pandas and SciPy for multilinear regression I wrangled and analyzed nba betting data from '07-'08 through '22-'23 NBA seasons to see if betting on the point spread is actually more profitable than betting on the moneyline underdog. This project was in an applied data science class where we went through the entire process of hypothesis formation and testing, actual analysis of results and confirmation/denial of your hypothesis, and a formal presentation of findings. You can view the slide deck here.</p>

      <h3>Network Enabled TicTacToe</h3>
      <p>This was a software engineering project. Written in Java, we created a Tic-Tac-Toe with a fully working GUI, that would allow 2 people on the same network to play TTT. We used a work infrastructure similar to the Agile framework.</p>

    <hr class="smalldiv">
    <h3>RPG Game</h3>
    <p>Written in python, we created a small but robust RPG style game. It had save state capabilities, allowing for many characters with their own inventories and names. It had a combat and leveling system, allowing for visible progression through the game, as well as the option to fight a final boss when leveled high enough.</p>
